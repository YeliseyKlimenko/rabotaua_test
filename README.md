# rabota.ua_test
## Instructions 
### Task 1
Run the task1.py script. It will load all the csv files from the 'task1' folder into a database, then showcase my implementation of the queries from the first task of the test. <br> You can also find them in the code.
### Task 2
Almost everything I did is described in the task2.ipynb file. The dataset is loaded into a pandas dataframe, all the necessary transformations are performed, then I scrape company web pages for extra data that I later add to the dataset.
